# Sorting visualizer

Web app which provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms. It currently has support for:
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Cocktail sort

This repo is an improved version of my very old [sorting visualizer](https://github.com/crisszkutnik/sortingvisualizer)
